        <h1>Korean Stir Fry</h1>
        <h2>A delicious, slightly spicy stir fry</h2>
        <p>
            This dish really hits all the boxes. It is sweet, spicy, umami, salty deliciousness. It is based on the Korean Jeyuk Bokkeum.
            The main differences are that while Jeyuk Bokkeum is a pork dish, I encourage you to try this with chicken, pork, beef, and
            even tofu. (I imagine it is great with shrimp or fish too, but I have not tried that yet.) In addition, I add almost any
            vegetables I have on hand and make it with quite a bit more sauce than the original Korean recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            I make this so often, twice a month sometimes.  It is so easy to make and so quick.  I usually eat it over cauliflower rice and
            make it with tofu more often than anything for health reasons.  You can add and take away or substitute in this recipe very easily,
            using honey in place of brown sugar, using less gochuchang for less of a kick, or low-sodium soy sauce.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tbs soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 tbs minced garlic</li>
            <li>4 tbs brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 tbs mirin</li>
            <li>3 tbs sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 tbs gochuchang</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>
                1 lb chicken, beef, pork, etc. cut into cubes.<br>
                (If using tofu, I normally just use one block of extra firm.)
            </li>
            <li>2 lbs stir fry vegetables</li>
            <li>Cooked rice or cauliflower rice to serve</li>
            <li>Sliced green onion and sesame seeds for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, garlic,
                brown sugar, mirin, sesame oil, gochuchang, and pepper
                for the sauce. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet on high heat. Once hot, add the protein and cook,
                browning all sides. Store protein in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Next, in the same skillet on medium high heat, saute the vegetables until just barely cooked.  Add cooked vegetables to the same bowl with the protein.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce to the empty skillet on medium high to high heat and cook until reduced by at least 1/3.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables and protein to the sauce and mix until well coated in sauce and heated through.  Remove from heat and serve over rice and garnish.</li>
        </ol>
