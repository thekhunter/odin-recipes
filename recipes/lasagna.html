        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <h2>Homemade Lasagna Recipe From Scratch</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a project and takes 24 hours or more if you are going to make your own homemade italian pork sausage, the homemade pasta dough, and the homemade tomato and vegetable sauce. As always, not everyone has the time or energy to do those
             things and are free you use whatever cheat you like.  You can sub in ground beef for the sausage if you prefer, and the homemade pasta can be substituted for pasta sheets that are usually available in the refrigerated section of most grocery stores
             (please don't use the boxed dry lasagna noodles).
        </p>
        <p>The sauce and the ricotta are the really important parts here, so even if you do buy storebought sauce, I would recommend adding in some sauteed vegetables and mushrooms in to give it some flavor. The ricotta should be whipped thoroughly with the
            eggs, salt, and herbs to give it flavor and help it set properly so you don't have a droopy lasagna that falls apart.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>fresh pasta sheets</li>
            <li>homemade tomato vegetable sauce</li>
            <li>homemade italian pork sausage</li>
            <li>1 qt ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>fresh herbs(basil, oregano, parsley)</li>
            <li>16 oz of shredded mozzarella or italian blend cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preheating the oven to 350 and boiling a pot of water for preparing your pasta sheets.  This should be well salted(salty as the sea). Bring to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li>Whip together the ricotta, eggs, and herbs and salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Brown the sausage, then add the sauce and allow to thicken a bit.</li>
            <li>Add a few sheets at a time to the gently boiling pasta water.  Allow to cook for no more than 3 minutes.  For fresh pasta, this will not
                 cook it completely, but will leave the pasta with some ability to absorb some of the excess moisture during baking. remove from pot and let cool on a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Now to build the lasagna, you will want a very deep baking dish, at least 3 inches, 4 inches if possible. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta, then a layer of meat sauce,
                topped with a sprinkle of cheese.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of pasta, then for this layer you will put a thick layer of the ricotta blend, topped with another sheet of pasta.</li>
            <li>The next layer will be sauce with shredded cheese, then pasta, then a layer of ricotta, and so on, until you run out of space or pasta. On the top layer, make a thin layer of sauce, with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake, covered, for about 40-50 minutes, then remove the cover and bake until cheese browns evenly.</li>
            <li>Cut, drizzle with olive oil, top with fresh shredded parmesan and cracked pepper and serve.</li>
        </ol>
