        <h1>Zucchini Bread</h1>
        <p>
            This is my own personal zucchini bread recipe. I add a few non-traditional spices, but otherwise it is a very traditional
            zucchini bread.  Feel free to omit the non-traditional spices and just go with cinnamon for the classic taste, but I think
            the spices really add a great depth of flavor.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup neutral oil (vegetable, canola)</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded zucchini</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 and grease and flour two 8" x 4" loaf pans.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs until thick and pale yellow (I prefer a stand mixer for this using the whisk attachment).</li>
            <li>Add the sugar to the eggs and whisk until just incorporated. Then add the oil and whisk again until just incorporated.</li>
            <li>At this point, I switch to the paddle attachment and mix in the vanilla and zucchini, again until just incorporated.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix all the dry ingredients until it looks uniform, then add to the egg mixture while mixing. Mix in the nuts at this point, if desired. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Pour into the greased and flour loaf pans until 2/3 -3/4 full and bake for 55-60 min, until a toothpick comes out clean or mostly clean (some crumbs are ok, but wet batter is not).</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and immediately remove from baking pan, setting to cool on a grid wire cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve.  I like to serve with butter to spread and some decent coffee.</li>
        </ol>
